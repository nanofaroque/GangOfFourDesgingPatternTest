****************************
The Adapter pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to
work together by converting the interface of one class into
an interface expected by the clients.

In our example, EnemyTank and Robot is different. EnemyTank fires
where Robot smash with hands. We tried link those property together 

******************************
Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and 
its used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object 
that joins these unrelated interface is called an Adapter. As a real life
example, we can think of a mobile charger as an adapter because mobile 
battery needs 3 volts to charge but the normal socket produces either 
120V (US) or 240V (India). So the mobile charger works as an adapter 
between mobile charging socket and the wall socket.

We will try to implement multi-adapter using adapter design pattern 
in this tutorial.

So first of all we will have two classes â€“ Volt (to measure volts) and 
Socket (producing constant volts of 120V).
